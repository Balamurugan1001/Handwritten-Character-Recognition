# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
          In this technological world, the bloom of scientific techniques is pushing up the limits of human outreach in various fields of technology. 
          Now a days the transformation of hard copy to digital form is inevitable. Neural computer is operated in way which is completely different from the operation of normal computers. 
          Neural computer is trained (not Programmed) so that given a certain starting state (data input); they either classify the input data into one of the number of classes or cause the original data to evolve in such a way that a certain desirable property is optimized. In this project a suitable algorithm is made for recognition of letters. The main objective of this project is to identify handwritten characters with the use of neural networks. We have to construct suitable neural network and train it properly. The program should be able to extract the characters one by one and map the target output for training purpose. After automatic processing of the image, the training dataset has to be used to train “classification engine” for recognition purpose. The program source code is done with the help of python
