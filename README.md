# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
## In this technological world, the bloom of scientific techniques is pushing up the limits of human outreach in various fields of technology. 
  Now a days the transformation of hard copy to digital form is inevitable. Neural computer is operated in way which is completely different from the operation of normal computers. 
          Neural computer is trained (not Programmed) so that given a certain starting state (data input); they either classify the input data into one of the number of classes or cause the original data to evolve in such a way that a certain desirable property is optimized. In this project a suitable algorithm is made for recognition of letters. The main objective of this project is to identify handwritten characters with the use of neural networks. We have to construct suitable neural network and train it properly. The program should be able to extract the characters one by one and map the target output for training purpose. After automatic processing of the image, the training dataset has to be used to train “classification engine” for recognition purpose. The program source code is done with the help of python Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as “training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, by modeling a neural network. Neural networks (NN) are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. Neural networks help us cluster and classify.
The basic requirements for this project are as follows:
1.	Python (3.7.4 )
2.	IDE (Jupyter Notebook)
The Required frameworks are:
      1.Numpy:It is a basic library which helps in manipulating arrays and comparing with
our project it helps us to convert different algorithms into functions especially NumPy is the one can be put to use along with data analysis and ML.
      2. CV2 (OpenCV) :This is the one which can develop real-time, computer vision  applications such as image processing, video capturing and even it also helps in object detection
      3.Keras:This is a neural network library used for developing deep learning models.
      4.Tensorflow :Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image pre-processing
      5.Matplotlib:It is the library used for creating static, animated and even for making interactive visualizations in python.
      6.Pandas:This is the most popular python library.

Then proposed work, results and analysis are discussed. Finally, conclusion and future scope is discussed which is followed by the references used in this paper.
